<opener>To Mr Nicolas Bernoulli. <lb/><salute>Dear Sir</salute></opener>
<p>It is with the greatest pleasure imaginable that I revive so long uninterrupted a correspondence, which I found not only agreable but instructing, I am obliged to owr friend Mr Cramer for many reasons but particularly that he told me you was well &amp; where you was. Upon my leaving Italy I retired into a Corner of Scotland to see my friends and staid longer than I designed, which among other inconvenien cies hindred me from corresponding with any of my friends abroad. But now I have taken the first opportunity to begin, for I make no doubt but you have now great store of Mathe matical Matters quite new to me, and on the other hand I shal be glad if I find that anything in owr way in this Country shal be agreable to you. Mr Cramer, as he left England but lately, can inform you of most things of moment which are on the Anvill. But I shal let you know of what has hapned since he left us, and indeed had raised owr expectation to a great height, but not to such a pitch as the matter deserved. </p>
<p> You must know that Sr Isaac Newton did not know till a few years before his death to what degree of exactness his Theory gave the place of the Moon. When it was first pub lished, there was a good correspondence betwixt Flamsteed and him, and accordingly Flamsteed told him that his Theory never disagreed above 2' from the place observed, and it was commonly believed that all, the difference was owing to the uncertainty of observation. Afterwards when there hapned a Difference between these two Gentlemen, Mr Flamsteed refused to communicate his Observations, and altho Sr Isaac by the Authority of Q. Anne got an order to seize his papers, andyet he gave but litle credit to them for that very reason, justly aprrehending they might have been given desig nedly false. In short Newton never knew how far his Theory dif fered from the truth till Dr. Halley succeded Flamsteed, he has got a fine new Quadrant of 8 feet Radius fixt in the Meridian, and has now had above 7 years observations of the Moon with it from whence it appears that Newton's Theory differs at most 8; and the Difference regularly decreases till it comes to no thing, after which it increases again, but never exceeds the foresaid limits. Dr. Halley designed to compleat the Theory by Induction after having taken Observations during an entire Revolution of the Apogee, he wants now but a year more, and perhaps may attain his end. </p>
<p> But Mr Machine has attempted the matter from the original cause, I mean the Theory of Gravity, and indeed I dare say with great success, altho hitherto he has only publi shed his chief Theorems without Demonstration, he has shewn the way of applying them, they are all extraordinary plain and easy in practice, and his numbers, when they disagree with Newtons, come nearer the truth. In short he has made the most difficult Propositions in the third book of Newton's more easy to be understood than can be imagined, or rather to speak more truly, he has invented more general Propositions of his own, which do the business better, and which he has demonstrated in a most perspicuous manner, we must wait his time for his Demonstrations, but in the mean time. I shal give you the principles and Method which he uses in his great improvements. </p>
<p> First he has a general way of considering the Motion of the Moon to and from the Center directly without considering it's angular motion. That is what Kepler calls the Libratory Motion. On this principle he has computed the Motion of the Apogeum &amp; Variation of the Eccentricity most accurately, the first of which was done but indifferently by Newton, and the second not at all. </p>
<p> His second principle is that if a body be deflected by two forces tending to two fixt points, it will describe by lines drawn from it to these two fixt points, equal Solids in equal times. Which is a noble improvement on Kepler's equal Areas in equal times in the case of a body being deflected to one fixt point. And by this he very easily explains and computes the Variation of Inclination of the Moon's Orbite. </p>
<p> He has what he calls his Equants which go through the whole, and are as follows. </p>
<p>Let the Moon for instance move from A to B it's angular Motion with respect to any point S, will be ASB. Let F be any point, draw lines from it to A &amp; B: he constructs a figure, whose Sector CDF is proportional to the Angle ASB. And finds the point C which will make the figure CD nearest to a Circle. The Angle ASB may be the Anomaly of the Moon, the Motion of the Node from the Sun, or Apogee from the Sun, or in short any angular Motion. The Curve CD he calls an Equant, it is an Ellipsis in most cases relating to the Motion of the Moon; this method brings to very easy and elegant Solutions of many Problems. </p>
<p> J lately sent Mr Cramer a Theoreme for interpoling by Quadratures, and now I have sent him an instance of the same by an infinite Series: and also an Example of finding the sum of a slow converging Series. The Book I have now in the press consists in Summing and Interpoling of Series, after a Method which J believe is new: he will shew you an instance of each. J shall reckon myself very Lucky if what J here have said, may excite you to send me some mathema tical news, for J am perswaded that you cannot but have good store of new inventions which J am a stranger to. J flatter myself that J shal soon hear from you, and J shal best know then what particular matters you desire most to be informed about. J am with great respect</p>
<closer>Sir Your most obedient &amp; most humble servant <signed>James Stirling.</signed></closer>

<p>P. S. J write to you in English because J know you are Master of it, but you may write to me in what language is most easy to you so as it be neither high nor low Dutch.</p>
