<opener><salute>Sir</salute></opener>
<p>J was very glad to hear of your welfare by your most obliging Letter, and have delayed answering it hitherto for no other reason but that J might be able at length to answere you in every particular: for seeing you desired the Demonstrations of the two Series which M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cramer sent you, and these Demonstrations are such as could not be conveni ently brought within the bounds of a letter, J thought it was best to stay till my Book was ready to be sent you; for you will find in it the principles explained by which J found these and such Series. Indeed J might have sent you my Book somewhat sooner, but unluckily J was taken up with an affair which obliged me far against my incli nation to defer my answere till this time. </p>
<p> As to Mr Machin's Treatise it was written in a great hurry and designed only to shew what may be expected from his larger Treatise on that Subject; and therefore it is no great wonder if you met with some difficulties in it, especially considering that not only his Propositions but also the principles from which most of them are deduced are new. J have prevailed on him to write an answere to that part of your Letter which relates to himself, which J now send you, and hope it will satisfy you entirely till you shal see the Book he is now preparing for the press: which J am confident will please you extremely, as it clears up the Obscure parts of Newton's third Book of principles and carrys the Theory of Gravity further than even Sir Jsaac himself did. And indeed it is somewhat strange that altho the principles have been published above fourty years, that no body has read further than the two first Books, altho they be barely speculative and were writen for no other reason but that the third might be understood. </p>
<p> The Theoreme which Mr Cramer sent you for Interpoling by Quadratures may, as you observe be deduced from one which you sent to Mr Monmort 15 years ago; and so may it as easily be deduced from a more simple one which Dr Wallis published 75 years ago, namely that <formula>\frac{1}{n}x^{n}</formula> is the Area of a Curve, whose Ordinate is <formula>x^{n-1}:</formula> and J value it so much the more because the Demonstration of it is so very easy. But neither your Theoreme nor that of Dr Wallis is sufficient except in that case when the series is so simple as to admit of Interpolation by a Binomial Curve, for if a Trinomial or more compound Curve be required, we must have recourse to the Comparing of Curves according to the 7 &amp; 8 Propositions of Newton's Quadratures, that being the general principle for this kind of Interpolation. </p>
<p> J agree with you that the series <formula>A,\frac{r}{p}A,\frac{r+b}{p+b}B,\frac{r+2b}{p+2b}C,\mbox{etc.}</formula> may be interpoled without Quadratures, as you will see by many Examples in the 21, 22, 26, &amp; 28 Propositions of my Book: but J am still at loss to find out that it is to be done after the manner you propose by putting <formula>\frac{r(r+b)(r+2b)\cdots(r+zb-b)}{p(p+b)(p+2b)\cdots(p+zb-b)}=\frac{r(r+b)(r+2b)\cdots(p-b)}{(r+zb)(r+zb+b)\cdots(zb+p-b)}</formula> or <formula>=\frac{(p+zb)(p+zb-b)\cdots(zb+r-b)}{p(p+b)(p+2b)\cdots(r-b)}</formula> {*} Indeed it is true that the Terms may be exprest by a Fraction, but to what purpose I know not; for if the Term required be an intermediat one, both the Numerator and Denominator of the fraction will consist of an infinite number of factors, and therefore that is no Solution, for it is as difficult, nay it is the very same Probleme, to find the value of such a fraction as to find the value of the Term proposed. The fraction no more gives the value of a Term whose place is assigned, than the place of the {*} Term being assigned gives the fraction. Besides, that method would not even give a primary Term which stands at a great distance from the begining of the Series; for the number of factors, tho not infinite, yet would be so great as to render the work altogether impracticable. </p>
<p> But here I except the case when the difference betwixt p &amp; r is not much greater than b, and at the same time is a multiple of it; this is the only case when your method will do, as far as I understand it; but when this happens, the Series is interpoleable by the bare inspection of the factors, even without the help of common Algebra: and there fore I hope you did not imagine that I designed to trouble a Gentleman of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cramer's abilitys with such a simple question or that I pretended to reduce it to Quadratures, altho per haps I might take it for an example of the general solution. </p>
<p> I cannot but think that one of us has misunderstood the other, and therefore I should be glad to have your method explained to me: for instance in the Series <formula>1,\frac{2}{1}A,\frac{4}{3}B,\frac{6}{5}C,\frac{8}{7}D,\mbox{ etc.}</formula> which is the simplest of all those which do not admit of an exact Interpolation; how do you find out that the Term which stands in the midle betwixt the first and second is equal to the number 1.57096<hi rend="sup">+</hi>....etc. You know J find it to be such from the method of Quadratures, which demonstrates it to be double the Area of a circle whose Diameter is Unity, And how doth your method give a Term remote from the begining, for instance the product of a million of these fractions <formula>\frac{2}{1}\times\frac{4}{3}\times\frac{6}{5}\times\frac{8}{7}\times\frac{10}{9}\times.....\frac{2000000}{1999999}</formula>, which I can find in the quarter of an hour to be the number 17724540724, as you may try by the Series which was sent you for finding the proportion which the midle Uncia in the Binomial has to the Sum of all the Unciae of the same Power. </p>
<p> Altho you are pleased to say that you have not spent much time on Mathematicks of late, it would rather seem to be otherways from the ingenious Problems which you mention; for my part, as their Solution depends not on new principles, and since I know not for what design they were proposed, I have not thought about them especially since you say that you have solved them already. Mr Klingenstierna shewed me a Construction of the Probleme about two Fires different from yours and extremly simple. He has also constructed the Probleme about a Curve revol ving about a point, and whereas you have said without any limitation that you found both the Curves to be Algebraical: he observes that it is so only when the Areas mentioned in the Probleme are to one another as one number is to another. He has also solved the Probleme about a Body falling doun in a Curve, and afterwards rising either in another or in the same continued; of which last you say videtur esse res altioris indaginis. And as to the Probleme about finding the latitude of a place and declination of the Star {*} from having three altitudes of it, and the times betwixt them; it is evident at first sight how it may be brought to an Equation. </p>
<p> Mr Klingenstierna had shewed me that part of your Demonstration of Cotes's Theoreme, which you had ready when he left you; and M.<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Cramer sent me the same with the remaining part which you sent to him about the begining of this Year: indeed I take it to be an elegant demonstration and far superior to that of the person you mentioned. But I suppose you know that Mr. De Moivre found out his Demon stration of the same Theoreme very soon after Mr Cotes's Book was published, which is now many years ago: and I am of opinion that it will please you, as it requires no computation. And now I come to beg pardon for this long letter and to assure you that I am with the greatest respect</p>
